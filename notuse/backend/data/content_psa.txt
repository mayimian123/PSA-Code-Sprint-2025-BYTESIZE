History：
PSA Singapore is one of the flagship terminals of PSA International, a leading port group with a global network encompassing 179 locations in 45 countries.
Where we come from:
PSA, formerly known as the Port of Singapore Authority, was a statutory board regulating, operating and promoting the Port of Singapore in the 1960s. (Note: PSA dropped the name of “Port of Singapore Authority” in 1997 when it became a corporatised entity. The company should be referred to as “PSA International” or simply “PSA”.)

In the 1970s, PSA started a container port and handled their first container ship. In the following decades, PSA grew and reached the 5-million TEU mark by 1990, making Singapore the world’s largest container port then.

In 1996, PSA’s regulatory functions were transferred to Singapore’s new maritime regulator, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA). A parliamentary bill was passed on 25 August 1997 to convert the Port of Singapore Authority, a state organisation, into an independent commercial company.

PSA Corporation Limited (simplified Chinese: 新加坡港务集团) was corporatised on 1 October 1997. The company kept the initials “PSA” as its brand name but it is no longer an acronym.

PSA took the first step in becoming a global terminal operator in 1996 when it embarked on its first overseas venture in Dalian, China.

Today, PSA is a world leading ports and terminals group.
What we do:
Transhipment – the movement of cargo from one vessel to another while in transit to its destination – is PSA Singapore’s core business.

Singapore’s strategic location at the heart of Southeast Asia and the nexus of major shipping routes has made it an important logistic hub and a key node in the global supply chain.

With its unrivalled connectivity, small feeder vessels bring containers to the Port of Singapore for loading onto larger vessels which then carry the shipments to their destination.

The value of transhipment lies in time-saving and cost efficiency. If every vessel makes a single direct voyage to its destination port, the number of journeys will be significantly higher than if transhipped via Singapore.

Our Vision
To be a leading supply chain ecosystem orchestrator powered by innovation, technology and sustainable practices.

Our Mission
To be the port operator of choice in the world’s gateway hubs, renowned for best-in-class services and successful partnerships.
Committed to Excellence
We set new standards by continuously improving results and innovating in every aspect of our business.
Dedicated to Customers
We help our external and internal customers succeed by anticipating and meeting their needs.
Focused on People
We win as a team by respecting, nurturing and supporting one another.
Integrated Globally
We build our strength globally by embracing diversity and optimising operations locally.
Responsible Corporate Citizenship
We work sustainably and with the environment in mind, to hand over a better world to future generations.
Our Bo-men
A total of 36 ‘Bo-men’ of varying sizes now reside in the PSA Horizons building in Singapore, alongside 11 in our upcoming Tuas Port. They can be found at key points starting from the drop off foyer to the main lobby and up through the building to the sky garden’s above.
Being Alongside
‘Alongside’ reflects PSA’s shared desire to Be There for all our stakeholders – by building great teams and partnerships, connecting communities, and orchestrating supply chains together for mutual gain and sustainable growth.

Daisy Boman
PSA’s brand manifesto – ‘Alongside’ – is reflected in these sculptures by Daisy Boman, a world-renowned artist who creates unique pieces that are a tribute to the shared bonds between individuals who form part of a united and cohesive culture of people.

Through the art of sculpture, Daisy and her Bo-men embody this same spirit of being Alongside in their form and posture, conveying this unity of purpose with diversity, equity and inclusion, suspended in time.

Container Terminals
PSA Singapore’s 55 berths at the City Terminals, Pasir Panjang Terminals and Tuas Port possess a container handling capacity of 43.9 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). The terminals operate as one seamless and integrated facility.

PSA’s latest facilities at Pasir Panjang Terminals and Tuas Port can serve the world’s largest container vessels. They are equipped with 18-metre deep water draft, quay cranes with reach across 24 rows of containers and supported by a fully-automated electric yard crane system.
Tuas Port
PSA Singapore container terminals will eventually be consolidated at a single location – Singapore’s western seaboard in Tuas. It is currently the world’s largest fully automated container terminal and will have an annual handling capacity of 65 million TEUs when it’s fully completed in the 2040s.

Automated equipment and integrated operations systems will be deployed to operate this next generation port. The first set of berths at Tuas Port Phase 1 have started operations since 2021.

Beyond handling containers, Tuas Port is envisaged to be a key node of a wider supply chain ecosystem that links future industries and their supply chains physically and digitally.

Proximity and partnerships with synergistic industries will complement the build-up of cargo solutions. Our vision is to form a holistic ecosystem that will bring goods anywhere in the world faster and more reliably.

Multi-Purpose Terminals
Pasir Panjang Automobile Terminal (PPAT), which started operations in January 2009, is PSA’s vehicle transhipment hub and Singapore’s first dedicated car terminal. PPAT has three dedicated berths and is supported by an open car yard and a multi-storey car storage yard, which together provide some 20,000 car park lots.

Sembawang Wharves handles break-bulk and specialised cargo which includes heavy equipment, steelworks, and cables. Sembawang Wharves also offers long and short-term warehousing and open storage facilities.
PSA Jurong Island Terminal
Jurong Island Terminal is located in the western corner of Jurong Island – the centrepiece of Singapore’s energy and chemicals sector. The two berths at the terminal handle two barge sailings a day with a total capacity of 400 TEUs.

In PSA Singapore, sustainability is not an option, but a responsibility to ensure the resiliency of our business, enabling growth without compromising on the environment and needs of the next generation. Our targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are aligned with Singapore’s climate ambitions.
To date, PSA Singapore has developed decarbonisation efforts across our entire value chain – Scope 1 (direct emission from our equipment), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from power generation) and Scope 3 (all other indirect emissions in our value chain).
The decarbonisation of port operations is the focus of PSA Singapore’s Environment, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) framework.We have actively reduced our dependence on fossil fuels. Our three-track decarbonisation strategy – low-carbon fuels, renewables and electrification – dovetails with our overall business expansion and sustainability strategies.
